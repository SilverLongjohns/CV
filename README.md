## Jacob Cummings

Hi! I'm Jake, an enthusiastic developer working on projects to make lives easier. I've built projects linked to influential software such as Spotify and Discord.

## Skills

#### Team Player

- During a project, the most important skill is being able to encourage and work with your team effectively. Motivation and teamplay are at the core of my work. 
- Throughout the Makers course, I held weekly stand-ups for the students in my cohort. This allowed us to knowledge-share effectively and air any blockages or problems we were having as a group.
- Testimony from a pair programming partner:

"You were very patient in your teaching and your excitement really made it enjoyable to listen and understand what you were teaching. You showed determination in completing the task at hand and explain your logic in a very clear way. You also read the error messages which prevented us from going around in circles. I will definitely want to pair with you again."

#### Self-Starter

- I have lots of experience in figuring things out for myself and building a successful work environment from nothing. During my time as a Business Development Executive, I brought in clients from Europe with little to no groundwork. I contributed to the growth of my company through bringing in new business and providing excellent service to my clients.
- This has taught me excellent methodology by which to get settled in almost any environment and make it my own.
- Communicating with clients from foreign countries such as France an germany has helped me hone in on the best ways in which to learn and communicate in new languages, a skill which has become invaluable in software engineering.

## Experience

Careers in Audit (Sept - April 2019)    
*Business Development Executive*  
Through regular client meetings and advisory sessions, I developed the ability to work with a variety of people from all sorts of professional backgrounds. Due to the small business environment, I worked in tandem with different departments, keeping communication and workflow clear and effective.A self-starter mentality wasparamount and I learned to build my own desk.

Airbus Space and Defence (2015)   
Mission Systems Intern
I was tasked with researching advantages of unmanned missions into space and weighing the cost benefit when compared to their manned alternatives. This allowed me to become comfortable with self-motivated research, while laying outinformation coherently

French Foreign Ministry (2011)
Press Intern
Translated a variety of documents for both international press releases and communications with foreign officials. Learned at a young age to work with meaningful documentation and work to a deadline.

## Things That I'm Proud Of

SpotiPhyte: https://github.com/SilverLongjohns/spotiPhyte
- A JavaScript application in which you grow a plant by playing it your music! Uses the Spotify API to read your library and currently playing tracks. This was an awesome experience which taught me much about everything from authentication processes to game design!

RegaliaBot: https://github.com/SilverLongjohns/RegaliaBot
- Currently in development! A Discord chat bot which provides many quality-of-life services for a gaming community of over 150 people! This project is constantly teaching me how to work with users to produce the cleanest and most functional features and how to maintain an in-use service.
